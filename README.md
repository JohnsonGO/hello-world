How to computer program
My name is Gabe Johnson and I am using github to create a new mobile game. I was inspired to do this from the game "Shellshock" which is one of my favorite games ever. I am basically brand new to coding except for what I learned in my first two years of high school engineering.
Hopefully with Github I can make an exciting new phone game that many peaople can enjoy.
